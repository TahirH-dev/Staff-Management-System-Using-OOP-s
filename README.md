# ðŸ“Œ Staff Management System Using OOP

A simple Python project that demonstrates the power of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts such as classes, inheritance, encapsulation, mixins, and more.  
This project manages staff data such as teachers and developers, including their names, salaries, and contract details.

---

## ðŸ“œ Features
- Add new staff members (Teachers, Developers)
- Store and display staff details
- Handle salaries and contract types
- Uses **OOP principles**:
  - Classes & Objects
  - Inheritance
  - Mixins
  - Encapsulation (getter/setter using `@property`)
  - Class methods and static methods

---

## ðŸ›  Technologies Used
- **Python 3.x**
- **Object-Oriented Programming**
